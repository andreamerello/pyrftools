My collection of scripts for miscellaneous RF calculations
==========================================================

Nothing particularly cool, but a bunch of scripts.

- dish_gain.py: estimate gain of a dish reflector given the diameter and the target frequency
- los_loss.py: calculate signal drop on a los path, given the distance and the frequency
- miscrostrip_L.py: calculate the inductance of a microstrip given it's length, width and total distance
